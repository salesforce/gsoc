### JARM – [salesforce/jarm](https://github.com/salesforce/jarm) ###
This project is open to original proposals from participants.

* Build a JARM fingerprint to server application database* with confidence levels to be utilized by the community.

* Build features into JARM that will allow it to further identify, with high confidence, the server application. This can be done with further server application fingerprinting that has yet to be identified/invented such as deeper application probing. The student would be involved in the investigation, feasibility, and invention of these additional capabilities.
